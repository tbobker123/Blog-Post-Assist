Related: 7 Best Music Player UI Design Inspiration The growing popularity of Video Player UI The world seems to be moving towards video as a preferred format, as it feels more real and engaging than still images. Video content on the internet can be more versatile than plain text with images since videos can include all those things, as well as a human face who delivers the message. This can be seen in the rise of popularity for YouTube videos, Instagram reels, and TikTok in recent years. Many young people also seem to be more comfortable listening to someone deliver a message, than reading a long text about it. A natural consequence of this rise in popularity for videos is that designers will be working to design products, websites, and apps that contain more video player UI components as well. To help in this task, I’ve curated this post of the best video player UI designs for inspiration, as well as design tips. Tips for designing a video player UI The basic structure and layout of a video player is quite similar in most design cases. You need a viewable screen, and settings to navigate the video with. Buttons and settings are usually set to the sides and bottom of the viewable screen. However, there are some details in a video player UI design that can make a video player component look a bit more polished, clean, and improve the user experience. Here are some examples of elements that can improve the design of a video player: Desktop Video Player UI Design Note! These designs are curated and not my own, credit to each designer is given below every image with a link to the source. Dark Mode In this example, we can see both the implementation of using opaque/translucent backgrounds, as well as a minimal style on overlays. In cases like this, where the UI elements are so stripped-down, you want to especially make sure that the touch-areas are big enough. In desktop video screen UIs, elements such as live chat and comments can be placed on the side of the video to make it less disruptive. On mobile devices, I’d recommend allowing the user to hide chat overlays to allow for full experience of viewing the video. When the user has paused the video, you can overlay the screen with relevant or promotional elements. Since the video isn’t in an active mode, they won’t experience disturbance by this. But I would not recommend you to overlay too much promotional content on videos that are playing, since that often just disrupts the viewing experience. Light mode Here’s an example of comments that are attached to a specific timestamp, which can be a fun and engaging feature for users. In the future, it would be cool if we could have interactive overlays on videos such as in the design below. Mobile Video Player UI Design Designing video players interfaces for mobile screens is of course more challenging since you are working with a much more limited space. Overlaying elements on top of the video can easily make the user frustrated, accidentally click wrong, or feel like they aren’t able to view the content as they wish. On mobile devices, I’d therefor especially make sure that non-essential overlays are easy to dismiss or hide. For example, you can allow users to tap on the screen to hide all overlays. Another feature I’ve observed in recent times is the use of clickable list of content. This is an idea I think has been borrowed from how books often have a first page which an overview of the content, that allows the user to skip to what interests them. It’s definitely a feature I’d recommend to implement in video content that is informative or divided into sections of topics. I hope this could give you some good video player UI design inspiration!

Social media    Media Players In Mobile User Interfaces Advertisement Media players in mobile user interfaces, comparing to other design elements, are allowing a little bit more design creativity and this should and is exploited by designers at maximum. The media players, either for video or audio, have a wide selection of styles and shapes. These look good and at the same time keep a good user experience, which is a really important factor of designing for mobile and actually for every medium.

Level up your design workflow Nacho Allendesalazar Simplestream 2 iOS &amp; 2 Android devs + Me as the designer 3 weeks design + 4 weeks development UX Design &amp; UI Design Sketch, Zeplin, Principle Designed a powerful video player live in 40+ apps Summary I lead the redesign of Simplestream’s iOS video player. We refreshed the UI, improved the navigation &amp; added new advanced features like live streaming and an in-player Live Channel Changer. All with the constraints of building a White Label product lives inside dozens of apps and serves hundreds-of-thousands of people around the world. Context The challenges of building a white-label platform Simplestream is a B2B2C SaaS company. We build advanced streaming apps for media companies based on a common white-label framework. Any given time, each of our 16+ clients has their own version of our app live on the app store. Each with a unique architecture, colours scheme, content, copy and language. Our design must work well for our small clients with no live channels, our bigger clients with 60+ channels and everyone in between. This is what the iOS app of some of our clients looks like. As you can see, the home screen looks similar, but the colours, architecture, content and fonts is different. Key Drivers of the new player The interest on &quot;internet TV&quot; is growing. We need to enable our clients to easily stream dozens of live channels right from our app. Our player can&#x27;t support live content so we are taking the opportunity to completely rebuild the player into one of the most advanced in the industry. 1. Support the most advanced live video streaming. Our player must seamlessly play 4 different types of Live and VOD video streaming, 2. Be re-skinned to fit our client’s branding and re-architected to fit their app’s functionality. The player must respect accessibility and maintain performance no matter the branding and content of the app. 3. Provide a solid foundation for any future improvements. Simplestream is growing fast, we need our player design to remain flexible and be able to adapt to any future requirements. BEFORE and AFTER of the player redesign Research Competitor analysis Many of the biggest tech companies (Netflix, Youtube, Facebook, Amazon…) rely on video to attract users and dedicate an enormous amount of resources to their players. As a small team, learning from their decisions by analyzing the designs of these billion-dollar companies was invaluable. It allowed us to create a custom solution that is orders of magnitude better than what we could have done on our own. Heuristic Evaluations offered a systematic approach to uncover the design decisions of the best players. We looked at dozens of players, performing a deeper analysis of the 6 that best matched our requirements (Youtube, Netflix, BBC, VLC, Infuse4 &amp; Amazon Prime) Bringing screenshots into Sketch to analyse minute details User interviews Throughout the project we used the following interview pattern: 1. We fist engaged users through directed interviews asking a prepared set of question (e.g. can you take me through the process of watching a video on your favourite streaming app?) 2. We then moved to a non-directed interview style, asking open-ended questions about their video watching and player habits. Insights from these interviews shaped almost all elements in the UI, from the button layout to the all-new channel changer screen. Early Findings 1. When designing utilitarian screens like a player, a user&#x27;s existing mental models become central to their experience. Users have built strong mental models of how a player works and get frustrated when it doesn&#x27;t behave as expected. 💡 Insight: Most players are very similar  -  users like that. Bells and whistles (custom layouts, fancy buttons, complex gesture control…) are only welcomed by a minority of users. 2. As long as watching the content is straightforward, users don&#x27;t think (or care much) about a player&#x27;s UI. 💡 Insight: As a designer, this was a hard realisation although it soon made the project that much more interesting. We were building one of the most advanced players in the industry, and it forced us to find solutions that feel effortless and familiar to the user. 👀 The takeaway: Our goal is to wrap our complex features and restrictions under a UI so simple and intuitive users won’t even notice it. Our process A better outcome by separating the UI into its components Tight constraints and a component-based approach to design allowed us to move directly from rough paper sketches into high-fidelity prototypes. ⚠️ Mini-problem: tracking and comparing different iterations of our components was proving a real challenge. ⭐️ Mini-solution: we came up with an innovative way to use symbols in Sketch. It allowed us to separate the UI into 16 basic building components (e.g. background, overlay, play button, title…) and quickly and consistently swap those components in a way that made easy to compare even small iterations. 🎯 Impact: our approach sped up the design. Unexpectedly, it was especially useful during user testing, allowing us to swap components in and out in a matter of seconds. On this example, we were able to change the background to compare how different layouts performed. Some of the player overlays we tested User testing We created high-fidelity prototypes using Principle which even allowed us to play a video in the background to offer a realistic experience to out test participants. Problem  1: Define a layout and navigation  🥅 Goal: Intuitive controls that seamlessly adapt to changes in the back end. After dozens of iterations, we compared 3 finalist UIs head to head in user tests. 60+ VOD player iterations The three finalist UI that were tested Final player UI Testing high-fidelity prototypes showed a ‘Netflix like’ bottom layout far outperforms other solutions. ✅ Users found it easier to use. ⚠️ Mini-Problem: with icon only buttons (see option 1 below), users had problems identifying our less common buttons like the &#x27;live channel changer&#x27;. ⭐️ Mini-Solution: A bottom layout provides enough space to add text to each icon, making it a lot easier to understand. ✅ Effortless taping for all users. Buttons at the bottom of the screen were easier to reach by both left and right-handed users. ✅ Flexibility for our clients. This pattern accommodates extremely well all types of streams, content types and user statuses with minimal changes to the UI. Problem 2: Live stream interface  We created dozens of solutions. Testing with users was essential to iterate on this subtle UI changes. 🗺 Context: our player must support 4 types of VOD and Live video streams. Each stream type has subtle changes in functionality that proved a challenge to communicate effectively to users. ⚠️ Problem: these changes in functionality can be very subtle but important for a user’s experience. Here is one example: some live channels can be paused and scrolled backwards while others can only be watched live; how can we let the user know the difference? What happens when a user scrolls back on a live channel so it’s no longer live? We needed to answer these and similar questions. 🤔 Challenge: create a UI that 1- instantly lets viewers know which type of stream they are watching. And 2 - makes it clear which functionality is available to them. Due to the complex requirements, live was among the most iterated and tested parts of the UI. Live player UI 1 The channel logo provides a clear indicator to the user that they are on a live stream and which channel they are watching. 2 The stop button is a subtle cue that the stream can’t be paused. 3 The circular handle used to indicate the current playing position disappears. 4 The &#x27;LIVE&#x27; tag also serves to indicate a live the stream is live. 1 There is now a pause button, a subtle indication that pausing is available. 2 When watching live, the video time stamp disappears. When the user scrolls back, the time stamp reappears, marking the minutes behind live. 3 The circular handle used to indicate the current playing position reappears, indicating to the user that it&#x27;s an available action. 4 The live tag disappears whenever the user is not watching live. Learnings of working on the live UI: ⚠️ During user test, the Live UI results were mixed, although most users cold navigate without any problems, many didn&#x27;t relate changes in the UI to changes in functionality (e.i. the stop button meaning that the program can&#x27;t be paused.) ✅ This was to be expected when dealing with very subtle changes in the UI and functionality. We would have loved to spend more time refining these small elements, but it got to a point where we had to move on. ✅ We followed a &quot;do not harm&quot; approach. The final elements were those that created less confusion, even if they weren&#x27;t understood by all users. Problem 3: Allow users to browse other channels without leaving the player.  The channel changer is a very valuable feature both for our bigger TELCO clients and for Simplestream, as it would set our player apart from the competition. ⚠️ Requirements: because of our white-label, we needed a pattern that could accommodate both our larger clients (with 60+ live channels) and smaller clients with 2 or 3 live channels. Some of our initial concepts that made it into Sketch  We explored about a dozen solutions, settling down for two that slightly modified UI patterns already in production. This provided the benefit of being tried and tested, familiar to the user and easier to build by our devs. Our 2 finalist patterns User testing results Part of our presentation to stakeholders summarising research findings Final channel-changer UI After several rounds of tests and iterations, we decided to go with vertically stalked cards. ✅ White-label flexibility. This solution works great for clients who have 3 and 3 dozen channels. ✅ Easier to use. With long lists, users found it easier to scroll vertically. We enabled scrolling on the left hand of the screen for left-handed use. ✅ Browse and watch at the same time. With 60% of the current video is still visible, users can keep watching the current channel while browsing others. This was a much requested feature. Development &amp; Launch  Working closely with our developer team throughout the project meant we were able to catch and fix problems early during the design and development phase. The handoff was done using Zeplin. Design Review and launch For me, getting together with the developer for a design review is one of the most interesting yet nerve-racking moments of any project. We spent an afternoon together discussing differences and making the final adjustments directly in the code. Shoutout to Shyam Bhudia who made the whole process a breeze 👏👏 I took screenshots of every coded screen and brought them at a 1:1 resolution into Sketch where we could easily compare by overlaying design to code. Learnings What we did well ✅ Stress test our designs early and often. Working on a white label product, our UI must perform under all conditions, constantly stress-testing our design to make sure nothing breaks — what if the background is pure white? What about pure black? And highly contrasted?. What happens if the text is extremely short? And extremely long?… Actionable item: To make this process easier, we cleverly used symbols in Sketch to instantly swap images and channel logos throughout the UI to test for accessibility under all conditions. To test different copy on the UI, we used the free plugin Craft to replace the text with real data from some of our clients. I&#x27;ll write an article detailing these techniques soon. I now use these techniques on each one of my projects, saving me time and headaches down the road. What we need to improve ❗️ Map out all the possible screens and states beforehand and try to identify problem areas; it will save time in the long run. This is essential to make sure nothing gets left behind and to accurately estimate the time the design will take.Wanting to get started quickly, I only mapped the main screens, states and flows. These lead to underestimating the time some flows would take and in some cases to have to backtrack on design decisions.

How to Design Your Video Player with UX in Mind This article explores different video player controls, their purpose, and which controls to pick for specific use cases such as learning platforms, social media platforms, power users, or mobile users. Did you know how many cool power-user controls YouTube has? Read on! An engaging video player can attract more viewers. Modern video players can offer vastly more controls than the simple play–pause buttons of the early days. Take a look at YouTube nowadays. Users can navigate video segments using YouTube’s chapter functionality. This feature helps users quickly search videos for a segment that’s relevant for them. How often have you watched a video, hoping to find specific information, only to discover that it doesn’t answer your particular question? It’s frustrating! Savvy YouTubers worked out a temporary solution to this. They found it helpful to list the different segments together with timestamps in the description of the video. This solution still meant that you had to open up the description to scan for your specific question. On top of that, it just wasn’t easy for Google to index videos that handle different questions about a particular topic. Video player user experience encompasses so much more than adding chapters. A video player for an online learning platform demands different controls than a YouTube video or a simple teaser video on a product website. Why Does UX for Video Players Matter? Take a video platform like YouTube. Users consume content in various ways. Let’s explore how three different personas use YouTube: The above scenarios illustrate that a video platform hosts many different users who use it in various ways. Therefore, it’s challenging to pick the right controls and shortcuts to provide the best experience for all users. So, which video player controls can we find? Which Video Player Controls Exist? Many different video player controls exist. This list summarizes the controls you most often find:  Less common controls include the following:  Lastly, we shouldn’t forget how we display the current timestamp and the video length. The most straightforward solution is first to show the current video timestamp, followed by the total video length. In this example, we’ve paused the video at 40 seconds with a total video length of two minutes and 13 seconds — “0:40 / 2:13”. On the other hand, some video players show the remaining length of the video. Don’t do this, as it’s confusing for the user. The next section takes a look at common and more experimental keyboard shortcuts to navigate a video player. How to Design a Video Player for Power Users? As more and more users become familiar with keyboard shortcuts, the lack of them often will increasingly lead to a frustrating video player experience. Keyboard shortcuts improve user experience for power users. To give a personal example, I like watching Belgian TV online using their video platform. The platform implements a custom video player. Unfortunately, you can’t use arrow keys to rewind or fast-forward the video. On top of that, you can’t pause or unpause a video by hitting the spacebar. The video player forces me to use my touchpad and navigate my mouse to the small pause icon. Frustrating, right? Video players nowadays should at least implement a basic set of keyboard shortcuts to satisfy power users. But why limit options to these keyboard shortcuts? YouTube is a leading player in implementing keyboard shortcuts. Here’s what we can learn from YouTube’s power users: It’s great that YouTube both implements fast-forwarding/rewinding for 5 or 10 seconds. In case you’ve missed a small detail of a video, you can quickly rewind using the left arrow key. When you want to scan through a video, you can press the L key to scan the video with 10-second intervals. Different Types of Video Controls for Different Purposes Let’s discuss the various controls to implement for different purposes — such as educational videos, social videos, and mobile videos. Educational videos Educational videos on platforms like Udemy or Coursera implement different controls than regular video players. For instance, users often like to increase the speed of tutorial videos. For that reason, it’s a common control you find on these platforms. Moreover, educational videos go hand in hand with bookmark functionality. The user can bookmark a particular moment in a video and add a note. This functionality allows the user to mark important moments in a video for reference. Social videos Social videos benefit most from quick sharing options. YouTube allows you to share a video, but it’s not part of their standard set of controls. They’ve added this functionality below their video player. Still, it’s worth implementing quick sharing options as part of your video player controls. Don’t forget to add the ability to share from a specific timestamp. Most often, users want to share a specific moment in a video with friends. Twitch, on the other hand, allows users to clip videos directly from the video player. Clips allows Twitch viewers to quickly share the most uniquely-Twitch moments from broadcasts while enabling broadcasters to grow their channels through social sharing! It’s a great feature to quickly clip funny moments, fantastic gameplay, or other share-worthy moments.  Source: Twitch video player Mobile video players Mobile video players demand a simpler design. It’s not possible to add a multitude of controls to a mobile device’s screen. YouTube’s mobile video player, for example, provides the following controls: For mobile videos, though, shortcuts improve the user experience. For instance, double-tap the right side of your screen to fast-forward a video by ten seconds. The same applies to the left side of your screen to rewind a video by ten seconds. Moreover, you can swipe up and down to enlarge a video or display the search results again. Here, the focus lies with the speed of use, which positively affects the user experience. Conclusion: Define Your Audience To design the right video player, make sure to define your audience. Talk with your users to understand how they use your platform and video player. For instance, Twitch’s clipping functionality is unique among other video players. This functionality is perfectly tailored to its user base to quickly save a cool moment during a live broadcast. Don’t forget to keep power users in mind. They love using keyboard shortcuts to perform basic video actions, such as muting video sound, fast-forwarding a video, or entering full-screen mode. Take a look at all the available YouTube keyboard shortcuts to draw some inspiration! Finally, if you’ve got the chops to build your own video player, please keep the tips offered above in mind. But if you’re just looking for a ready-made solution, the discussion above should provide food for thought as you’re looking through available options.

Video player Signup to have the latest patterns & trends delivered directly to your inbox   Create a Slick Video Player UI in Photoshop Preview  Step 1: Create the Photoshop Canvas Create a new Photoshop document by going to File &gt; New. The canvas dimensions should be 800x600px. Set Background Contents to Transparent, which will produce a transparent Background layer.   Now, select the Paint Bucket Tool (G) from the Tools Panel and fill the transparent Background layer with a neutral color like #e4e4e4 (which is a light gray). Step 2: Create the Video Area A typical standard dimension for streaming videos is 640x390px. (YouTube, for example, uses this as the default video dimension.) Following this dimension, we&rsquo;ll create a rectangle and then we will add a smooth, black color gradient to it. To create the rectangle, select the Rectangle Tool (U).  In the Options Bar, make sure that the Shape layers option is selected so that the tool produces a shape layer instead of a vector path (which is the Paths option) or a rasterized shape (which is the Fill pixels option). Also, if you have the Info Panel up &mdash; which can be toggled by going to Window &gt; Info (F8) &mdash; it can help you draw the rectangle (and other objects in this tutorial) precisely.  Once you have drawn the rectangle, double-click on its layer in the Layers Panel to access the Layer Style dialog window.  Give it a Gradient Overlay with the following settings:  Step 3: Create the Control Bar The video control area is represented by the play button, full-screen button, volume button, the volume bar and the progress bar. We&rsquo;ll start with the shape on which the elements will lay on top of, which (for the purpose of this tutorial) we&rsquo;ll refer to as the control bar. To start, choose the Rectangle Tool (U) again and, under the big rectangle (video area), draw a rectangle sized at 640x40px.   Give the control bar an Inner Shadow. The settings below will give it a subtle inner shadow effect.  Also, give it a dark gray (#353535) Color Overlay layer effect.   At the top of the control bar where the video area and the control bar meets, draw a 1px horizontal black line. This line will give us a nice inset effect.  Step 4: Give the Video Player a Shadow Now I&rsquo;ll show you how to create a nice shadow effect around the video player. Select the Rectangle Tool (U), draw a black rectangle sized at 640x430px and place the layer under the video area and control bar layers. Next, choose Filter &gt; Blur &gt; Gaussian Blur, set the Radius to 2px, and then press OK to apply the filter.   Step 5: Add the Video Controls Let&rsquo;s continue with the controls. Next step is to import three icons into our document: a volume icon, a full-screen icon and a play icon. You can easily find icons through Iconfinder.  Also, try the free Wireframe Toolbar Icons, which are icons made for GUI designers; this icon set will have all the icons you need for this step. Look for plain and simple icons, which will give us a better opportunity to tweak and style them. Position your chosen icons as shown below.  If they are too big, use the Free Transform command (Ctrl/Cmd + T) to rescale them.  Double-click on the play icon&rsquo;s layer so that you can give it a Drop Shadow and Gradient Overlay. Drop Shadow  Gradient Overlay  You should end up with a clean play button as shown below:  Add the same effect to the other two buttons. To do this, right-click/Control-click on the play button layer (which should already have the layer style we applied above) and select Copy Layer Style. Ctrl-click/Cmd-click on the volume icon layer and the full-screen icon layer to simultaneously select them both, then right-click on one of them and choose Paste Layer Style.  Doing this should copy the layer style from the play button layer to both the volume icon and full-screen icon layers.  Step 6: Create the Video Progress Bar Choose the Rounded Rectangle Tool from the Tools Panel, set its Radius to 20px in the Options Bar, and then draw a 350x10px rounded rectangle. Use the Move Tool (V) to position it beside the play button as shown below.  Copy the layer style we gave to the play, volume, and full-screen buttons in the previous step, and then paste it onto this one.   Let&rsquo;s mock up our UI as though we&rsquo;re in the middle of playing a video. We&rsquo;ll do this by drawing a blue rounded rectangle on top of the progress bar that indicates the position of the video. First, load a selection around the progress bar by Ctrl-clicking/Cmd-clicking on the shape layer&rsquo;s thumbnail.  Then select the Rectangular Marquee Tool (M) and, in the Options Bar, choose the Intersect with Selection option. Make a selection around the first half of the progress bar. This should reduce our selection.   Create a new layer above the progress bar. In this new layer, fill (Edit &gt; Fill) your selection with any color. Once filled, double-click on the layer to access the Layer Style window so that we can give this layer a Gradient Overlay.   Now, at the middle of the progress bar, draw a 1px horizontal line with a blue color (#75aafb), which will add a nice detail to the progress bar. The progress bar should now look like this:  Repeat the process above to create a volume bar, but instead of using a rounded rectangle with a Radius of 20px, double it to 40px because the volume bar will be narrower than the progress bar.  Step 7: Write the Time Indicator Select the Horizontal Type Tool (T), set the font to Arial, Regular, 12px and type the current progress and the duration of the video at the right of the progress bar. Copy the layer style from the play button layer, then paste it onto the text layer.  Step 8: Create a Big Play Button on the Video Area The UI is now done. Now, we&rsquo;ll make a big play button at the center of the video area. You can use the same play icon you used for the video controls bar (just scale it up using the Free Transform command), or draw it yourself using the Polygon Tool (just set the Sides option in the Options Bar to 3 to draw a triangle).  Afterwards, give the layer a Drop Shadow, Inner Glow and Inner Shadow. Drop Shadow  Inner Glow  Gradient Overlay  Here&rsquo;s what the button should look like:  Tutorial Summary The video player is now done. We used simple techniques to draw a nice video player user interface. We used simple layer styles and drawing techniques (with Photoshop shape tools) to arrive at a clean and sleek aesthetic that you&rsquo;ll often see in modern web designs.
